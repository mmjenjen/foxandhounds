How to Run foxAndHounds.py

	•	Make sure the directory is set to sfan_mjennin3_final_project.py. Set the canopy preferences to Inline SVG if you are using a Mac or Interactive WX if you are using a PC.
	•	Run the program foxAndHounds.py.  Decide among you and your friend who player0 and player1 will be. Click on the instructions button for game directions. You can drag the instructions window to the side if you’d like to check back during the game. 
	•	If you have trouble moving the pieces with the clicking, you might need to click on the piece until there is not an error message before it will move (for example, if you click on the piece and then on an illegal spot, you may need to click on the fox or hound again before clicking a legal spot)
	•	When you are done with the game you may exit out the window or click the quit button.

Additional Notes:
The hound winning conditions do not always work. Sometimes in the lower areas of the board or on the sides it will not recognize a winning pattern. We have left the code that attempts to show a win in the program in hopes that it might work in certain areas of the board, but it is still iffy. 

The fox conditions should always work and we have not seen any bugs on that end. 

Enjoy the game!
